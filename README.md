# Remaning Work


* ~~When you first launch the app and select a menu option, there's a 2-3 second lag before it responds.  It'd be good to remove this lag.~~

* ~~The "Please choose a file" option is really bare-bones and requires the user to fully type out one of the listed options.  It'd be better to have numbers by each filename that can be entered instead to choose a file.  Or even better, an arrow pointing to the first file listed and then use the arrow keys to move up and down the options and press Enter to choose one.~~

* ~~When hitting a key to advance the generation, there's an underscore char that zooms down the screen.  It'd be good to remove this.~~

* Pressing Esc to quit a simulation exits the whole program.  It'd be better if it returned you back to the main menu instead.

* ~~When creating a new world with the dat file creation tool, it saves only to .\worlds\new.dat.  It'd be better to let the user specify the path/filename if they want to.~~

* ~~The dat file creation tool should have the "(ESC) to quit" option listed at the bottom as well.~~

* The functions that people wrote need to be documented with the standard function header description block.

* The Test Plan needs to include dat files that represent the 4 possible outcomes:
--> The colony quickly dies out
--> The colony rapidly expands (stopped only by the edge of the world).
--> the colony reaches a set stasis
--> the colony reaches an oscillating stasis (moves back and forth between 2 or more configurations)
